## Business Goal
Forecasts play a crucial role in the retail sector, serving as the backbone for supermarkets to shape their strategic growth, make informed tactical choices, and efficiently navigate demand and supply planning. Accurate forecasting is essential to prevent customer service disruptions and reduce excessive inventory expenses. Overstocking results in additional costs, while understocking can cause missed sales opportunities and reduced profit margins. In this context, our objective is to assist Walmart with predicting daily sales in the USA for the upcoming 28 days.
